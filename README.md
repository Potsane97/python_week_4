#  File I/O Challenges in Python  

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate **file handling** and **error handling** concepts.

## 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge
**File:** `question1.py.py`  
- Reads the contents of `input.txt`.  
- Counts the number of words.  
- Converts all text to **uppercase**.
